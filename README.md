## Assignment 1: Salary Prediction
The purpose of this assignment is to
1. Understand and explore employment in the data science community, as represented in a survey conducted by Kaggle
2. Train, validate and tune multi-class ordinary classification problem that can classify, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, what a survey respondent's current yearly compensation bucket is

Learning outcomes:
1. Understand how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, including working with multiple data types, incomplete data and categorical data. Perform data standardization and normalization prior to modeling.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to look for correlations between the features and the target variable.
3. Understand  how  to  apply  machine  learning  algorithms  (logistic  regression)  to  the  task  of classification.
4. Improve on skills and competencies required to compare performance of classification algorithm, including application of performance measurements, statistical hypothesis testing and visualization of comparisons.
5. Understand how to improve the performance of machine learning model through hyperparameters tuning using Grid Search method.
6. Improve on skill and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights.


## Assignment 2: Natural Language Processing of Tweets
The purpose of this assignment is to compute the sentiment of text information -in our case, tweets posted in 2019 Canadian elections -and answer the research question: “What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2019?” The goal is to essentially use sentiment analysis on Twitter data to get insight into the 2019 Canadian elections.

Learning outcomes:
1. Implement functionality to parse and clean data according to given requirements.
2. Understand how exploring the data by creating visualizations leads to a deeper understanding of the data.
3. Learn about training and testing machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, Naive  Bayes,  SVM, k-NN, decision trees, ensembles(Random  Forest,XGBoost).
4. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to the task of text classification.
5. Improve on skills and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights.

## Final exam project: 
The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms learned in this course to develop a tool that can text-mine this database of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tackle the outbreak, contain the spread and flatten the curve.

Learning outcomes:
1. Implement functionality to parse natural language biomedical literature data according to given constraints and requirements. 
2. Train and test machine learning algorithms (especially unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, association rules,etc.)in order to gain insights or answer the overarching question chosen to pursue for this project.
3. Understand how to apply machine learning algorithms to the task of learning from a large corpus of biomedical research text.
4. Improve on skills and competencies required to collate and present domain specific, evidence-based insights. Particularly, in this case to gain insights and guide the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
